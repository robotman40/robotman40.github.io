I have worked on several projects several, especially in the field of computer science. I am quite proud of what I've done,
so here is everything I would like to showcase:

- [battery-switcher-76](https://github.com/robotman40/battery-switcher-76) - A wrapper for the system76-power daemon for systems
from System76, a renowned Linux systems manufacturer, as well as Pop!_OS devices. It adds additional features that system76-power
lacks itself, such as automatic power profile switching.
- [rustzot_api](https://github.com/robotman40/rustzot_api) - A Rust crate that allows programs to conveniently retrieve data from
the [Anteater API](https://anteaterapi.com/reference) at UC Irvine.
- [ZotSky Mirror](https://bsky.app/profile/zotsky-mirror.bsky.social) - A bot on Bluesky that mirrors UC Irvine's X/Twitter posts
and integrates with Nitter, an alternate frontend for X/Twitter.

There are many other things I want to explore, such as contributing to open-source projects, writing essays, etc. I will post them here
when I do them.
