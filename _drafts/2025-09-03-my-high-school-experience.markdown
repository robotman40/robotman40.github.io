Recall the time you were a high schooler, did you enjoy it, hate it, or maybe a bit of both?
Well however you viewed how school, I think you have a unique story to tell. But I would like
to share mine here. I will describe it through a series of small sections.

## Was I Popular?
Depends on how you define it. Popular as in widely liked? Not really. Popular as in well known?
Pretty much. Thing is few people actually looked up to me as an "idol" in a high school sense. Like
I had a good character despite it sometimes overshadowed by my inner-turmoil, but I rarely did anything
that is considered noteworthy in high school; the closest being me earning a character award during senior sendoff.

It's not to say that nobody respected me; it was quite the opposite. The few people who did were close
to me and saw many great qualities in me. But I did attract some negative attention in my early high 
school years that made several cliques target me for bullying. For example, when I became a Linux nerd,
one clique of kids decided to use that to mock me. In another case, I tried to uncover an Instagram
shipping account's identity in a misguided attempt to become a "hero." I ended up accusing someone popular 
and I ended up on their bad side for the rest of high school.

But I ended up coming to the realization the popularity game was something I hardly had time to play; 
Instead, I focused on my academic and intellectual pursuits believing they would have more long-term
value. Besides, I learned that forming genuine relationships will bring you the happiness superficial ones
can't bring you. Like it's better to be surrounded by people who truly care for you and will always be by your side.

On a side note, because I identify as a nerd, I recommend reading Paul Graham's essay
[Why Nerds are Unpopular](https://paulgraham.com/nerds.html). I think it describes my social life and
attitude towards popularity accurately on many levels. For example, my aforementioned prioritization
of intellectualism.
