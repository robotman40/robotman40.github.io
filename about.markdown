I am Chris Rios, also known by the alias of Robotman40 online, a Computer Science B.S. major and Psychology

reading non-fiction, and working on software projects.

I have worked on several projects and ventures relating to the Computer Science field so far in my life: I was

User Group at UCI, and I have created open-source software projects like [battery-switcher-76](https://github.com/robotman40/battery-switcher-76)
and [rustzot_api](https://github.com/robotman40/rustzot_api).

such as my life experiences, advice, etc.
