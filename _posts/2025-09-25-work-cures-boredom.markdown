A man named Dale Carnegie once said this: "Inaction breeds doubt and fear. Action breeds confidence and courage. If you want to conquer fear, do not sit home and think about it. Go out and get busy." This is exactly what I learned this summer. In this post, I want to go over my learned experience on how to cure your boredom: getting busy.

For many of us, the root of our boredom is in how we feel like we aren't doing anything that is satisfying to us. In my case, I wanted to work on something... something of importance; I didn't feel like I could do it. This led me to a vicious cycle many of us have surely went through: I cannot do __ because of __, and I cannot do the latter because of __, and so on. 

Instead of finding excuses to not do anything, only focus on why you cannot do __. Once you identify that, work on solving what you think is holding you back and do not keep looking for excuses to not do __. In my case, I wanted to write computer software that was useful, but I didn't do it for awhile because I felt like my skills were inadequate. I wanted to start honing my skills, but I stalled because I thought I didn't have time. Turns out I had plenty of time: I just needed to use it efficiently. Like I had very few obligations, so why just sit around drowning in boredom as Carnegie said?

So I focused on what made me feel good: honing my programming skills. That's how I managed to work on three projects over the course of the summer, refine my Python skills, learn two new programming languages: Ruby and Rust, and start building my Linkedln. Where did that get me? I now have some things to showcase on my Linkedln, made a Linkedln contact during my move-in at UCI, and even managed to get an interview with a UCI startup arranged for me. Now I feel much happier and satisfied with my life compared to me from 3 months ago as of this writing.

Of course, this is just my experience. Everybody's got a definition of what makes them feel productive. It could be anything from learning an instrument, visiting new places, or even playing a video game in your backlog. What mainly matters is keeping boredom away and achieving tangible results that leave you happy.

So don't just sit around and question whether you're being productive. Wake up, get up, and get out there and do something. It might just be how you find your satisfaction and path forward in life.

Since Dale Carnegie's quote is the framing of this post, I highly recommend reading his book [https://www.amazon.com/How-Stop-Worrying-Start-Living/dp/0671035975](How to Stop Worrying and Start Living). I read it myself during this summer and I found it really helpful in overcoming my sloth, so I hope it can do the same for you. And hey, reading a book is also a productive thing, so reading this might be what you're looking to do right now.
