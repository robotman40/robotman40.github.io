In life, we may have gone through a time of struggle, but what if we could view it differently? I'm happy to say it is completely possible, and that's what I am here to show you.

## Was I Popular?
My popularity in high school was a question of definition. Was I widely liked? Not particularly. Was I 
well-known? Absolutely. But few people saw me as an "idol" in the typical high school sense. I had a good character,
despite my inner-turmoil sometimes overshadowing it, but I rarely did anything noteworthy. The closest I came 
was earning a character award during my senior year.

While I wasn't an idol, I wasn't without respect; it was quite the opposite. The ones who truly respected me
were close friends who saw my great qualities. But I did attract some negative attention in my early high 
school years that made me a target of bullying. For example, my love for Linux made me a target for one clique.
In another case, I made a misguided attempt to be a "hero" by trying to uncover an Instagram shipping account's
identity, only to accuse a popular person and land on their bad side for the rest of high school.

Eventually, I realized the popularity game was something I hardly had time to play; 
Instead, I focused on my academic and intellectual pursuits believing they would have more long-term
value. I also learned that forming genuine relationships will bring you a type of happiness superficial ones
can't. It's far better to be surrounded by people who truly care for you and will always be by your side.

On a side note, because I identify as a nerd, I recommend reading Paul Graham's essay
[Why Nerds are Unpopular](https://paulgraham.com/nerds.html). I think it describes my social life and
attitude towards popularity accurately on many levels. For example, my aforementioned prioritization
of intellectualism.

## My Favorite Subjects
Most of favorite subjects were in the mathematics department. In particular, I enjoyed AP Computer Science A,
AP Statistics, and AP Calculus AB.

Unsurprisingly, I found those classes to be fun because they relate to my major and field of interest. Being a
Computer Science major, I am very logical and prefer to solve problems that have a clear solution. For AP
Computer Science A, learning Java was a breeze for me and the teacher was the coolest one I had during high school.
AP Calculus AB was the hardest class I took as a senior, but it was fascinating because it tied together everything 
I had learned in math so far. AP Statistics was my least favorite, but I found working with data to be fun and interesting to understand.

Outside of mathematics, one class I particularly enjoyed was AP US History during my junior year. I took it only
because I excelled in World History in my sophomore year and thought I could do the same there. While it was definitely
much more challenging, I managed to excel and score a 5 on the AP exam. Another non-mathematics class I enjoyed was
AP Literature; despite English not being my métier, I ended up reading my favorite novel, Klara and the Sun, in that
class. The environment in that classroom was also the most lively one out of all my classes, which colored my senior year
days.

The point of this is to remind you all that your interests don't have to strictly relate to your field of interest. Taking
an interest in other fields will broaden your horizons and can even add more to your life.

## My Favorite Video Games as a High Schooler
My tastes in media evolved throughout high school; I was into multiplayer shooters as a freshman,
singleplayer action games as a sophomore, racing games as a junior, and one particular game series as a senior.

As a freshman, I was obsessed with Call of Duty and played it religiously. But I quickly got bored
and started exploring other games. When I built my first PC, I played Apex Legends, Splitgate, and Deep Rock Galactic
on a daily basis. Those games were my only escape from a difficult period in my life, but also drilled me deeper into my
emptiness at the time.

Then during my sophomore year, I tried branching out to more game genres and found myself into story-driven singleplayer games. Examples
of them are the Half-Life series, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Spider-Man, etc. While I enjoyed
these games, none of their messages truly resonated with me. Their stories felt distant and unrelated to my struggles.

When my junior came, my tastes shifted again. I was playing Forza Horizon 4 and 5. Although I enjoyed those games, I found
myself getting more joy taking virtual car photos rather than the actual racing. During this time, I also played Minecraft
regularly with my friends. Only Minecraft felt meaningful; it gave me a chance to strengthen the bonds I had with the people
who mattered most.

Finally, in my senior year, I started playing a video game series that would have a profound impact on me: Persona. On my
birthday, I got Persona 5 Royal, a game I was interested in for awhile. The turn-based combat was satisfying, and the characters
felt incredibly real. But most of all, I related to it deeply. The protagonist is a person who lost his place in society, which
mirrored my struggles in high school. My passion for the series was so strong that I went on to play Persona 3 Reload and
Persona 4 Golden. I even used the whiteboard in my AP Literature classroom to "preach" about the series, which you can see here:

Beyond being a fan, I feel like this game series was the catalyst for me becoming a more positive person. To elaborate, 
I mentioned that high school was a difficult time for me, but the Persona series carried a recurring theme: even in the most
challenging times, we can emerge from them stronger and wiser than before. That's why I worked towards bettering myself
at the end of my senior year. The result? I am now a person who is more confident than ever and can see the positive
side of life.

My point here is that the kind of video games, or even media in general, can influence who you become. Explore and find media
that positively influences you, instead of leaving you empty.

## Friendships
During my freshman year, I had no close connections as most of peers deemed me undesirable—different,
weird, and they even called me "[Professor Frink](https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Jonathan_Frink)." The only relationships I had
were superficial, leaving me with a deep sense of loneliness. For the first half of the year, I was in denial of my bleak social
situation, but when I opened my eyes to the truth, I felt devastated. Like I had no place in the school and wondered if I 
could ever find what I wanted, acceptance. 

I went into summer break with no friends to confide in, and I spent time wallowing in my despair; it was only when someone, who 
we'll call Mike, reached out to me. He was interested in me for some time, and over the summer, we developed a close friendship.

That friendship changed everything. I started my sophomore year in a better place. Mike introduced me to his friend group,
and while it took some time to get used to their dynamic, I finally found the sense of belonging I longed for. Despite our occassional
conflicts, we remained a closely knit group for the rest of high school and are still friends to this day.

My message here is that you should never lose hope, even when things seem completely hopeless. Endure the darkness until a ray of light shines through to guide you.

## Romance
My romantic life as a high schooler was pretty dormant. I was more focused on achieving personal and academic goals.
But I did briefly date during the summer after my junior year. A girl in my AP Computer
Science A class, who we'll call Ella, took an interest in me and asked to spend time together

I agreed, and we ended up sharing several sweet moments: we visited the local aboretum, walked at the local park, and even went to
the Griffith Observatory. While these weren't the dramatic settings you see in rom-coms, we enjoyed our time together and were always 
eager to hang out with each other. Aside from our outings together, we shared a chemistry
rooted in our shared ideals, interests, and struggles. For example, we both had a deep, long-standing interest in astronomy.

Not long into the next school year, we found ourselves occupied with lots of homework and had tests to study for nearly everyday.
Because of this, we believe it was best for us to break up so we could focus on our studies. Nonetheless, we remain good friends to this day.

This brief, yet meaningful experience taught me two things. First, romance should come from a deeper place in our hearts. And second,
what truly matters is whether you both genuinely enjoy the moments you share together.

## Involvement in School Life
For most of high school, my friends and I preferred spending Friday nights playing Minecraft together over
attending a football game. Our involvement in school was entirely on our terms. We created the Minecraft Club because 
we saw an opportunity for a side project, and we choose to go to Prom and Grad Nite because they felt like the perfect
"last hurrahs" for us.

This isn't to say I was anti-social or completely uninvolved. When I was genuinely interested, I would volunteer my time. I helped
several clubs, such as In Another's Shoes, where I advocated for disability awareness, and the Computer Science Club, driven by my
passion for the subject. I also participated when approached, as was the case with the Yearbook Committee.  When they asked to interview 
me about the Minecraft Club, I saw no reason to decline. I came in on two separate days to be interviewed and photographed,
and both sessions went by quickly.

My biggest takeaway from this experience is simple: There's nothing wrong with being involved in school life. In fact, it can be incredibly 
rewarding. But you should do it because you're genuinely interested and passionate, not because you feel pressured to follow what everyone else is doing.

## My Deepest Struggle
This is something I've been foreshadowing for awhile, and it relates to the previous sections. So this is where I finally talk about my deepest struggle in-depth.

For most of high school, I was living through a depressive episode rooted in my experiences during middle school. The first of these experiences 
was in late-sixth grade, where I had a crush on a girl we'll call Annabelle that ended horribly. She and her group of 
friends resented my feelings and began passionately gossiping about me, spreading rumors. What was an innocent crush in hindsight ended up making 
me a victim of exclusion from my peers. This would be followed by several experiences that deepened my struggles: 
my failure to notice a girl that was flirting with me constantly, the loss of a "friend" who didn't truly like me, etc.

I entered high school with a jaded and melancholic view of life. My aforementioned lack of satisfying relationships made me a bitter person: I envied
those around me who had friends, I felt heavily demoralized, and I resented those who caused me pain. This mentality ironically caused me to be seen as 
more unlikeable in the eyes of my peers.

As previously brought up, I found escapism in playing video games. I felt good being the player with the most kills and being the battle royale victor.
Yet escapism only does so much. When I would inevitably return to the real world, I felt even more empty than before. What I was doing did absolutely
nothing in improving my bleak situation. In other words, I ended up founding myself in a cycle of sloth that prevented me from confronting my problems.

But even while I was in the midst of a depressive episode, I ultimately did not give in. If anything, I emerged from it enlightened, a sentiment I expressed 
in my senior quote: "I journeyed through the abyss, and found my way to the light."

As high school went by for, I started to realize how much brighter the world than I allowed myself to see. I found a clique of supportive friends, achieved
high grades in my classes, and led several clubs in school. I even had people outside my friend group that cared for me more than I realized. And a video game
I previously mentioned, Persona, showed me that positivity is possible, even in the darkness. In essence, the beauty of life was there; I just had to open my eyes. 

That's when I began to confront my problems and I couldn't be happier with what that resulted in. I developed a newfound positivity and resolve that serves 
to remind me that even when things may seem grim, we must persevere and find the positives in life. And I want you can carry that mindset too. I believe that 
everyone deserves to be happy, even when life is difficult.

## Conclusion
Here is the key takeaway I want you to remember: even if it's not the life you envisioned, embrace it. You only live once, so you should make the most of your life. In my case, I was a social outcast and struggled with depression in high school, but did I let that defeat me? No. Instead I confronted my struggles and emerged as a stronger, more positive person. That's why I want my story to inspire you—even when life looks bleak, there is always a hidden beauty waited to be uncovered.
